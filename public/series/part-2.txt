<p>Wade sat on the vinyl couch, tapping his heel into the ground, almost violently. He was nervous to tell the story to a psychiatrist. It still made his heart pound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were responding to a call on Mission and Eighteenth. A witness saw an individual with a firearm enter an apartment building. My partner and I were the first to respond. The door was open. We entered the building after calling for backup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We went up the first and second flights of stairs, checking the halls. One of the residents came out of their unit and my partner secured them there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wade paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you need a moment-&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;-No, it&rsquo;s OK. I continued up. I was on the fourth floor when I heard footsteps coming down. I radioed my partner right when I caught up with this kid, probably twenty or so, pointing a gun at me. He shot me twice in the leg. I hit the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to even explain this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Officer Miller, try if you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sighed and scratched his head. &ldquo;I noticed it was a toy gun. He pulled the trigger again, but it didn&rsquo;t work. I fired my weapon once, striking him somewhere in the thigh, before he, uh . . . ran upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ran?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was really more like a sprint. Anyway, that&rsquo;s right when Jennings reached me. He pursued the kid up, got all the way to the roof, and found no one. There was nowhere to hide up there, either, from what I hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . Thank you, Officer Miller. We&rsquo;re finished. We should be in touch soon to see how you&rsquo;ve been feeling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wade shook his head as he stood on his crutch and left the room. He knew the psych thought he&rsquo;d lost it.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>In another room upstairs, two detectives sipped coffee as they watched Wade hobble off screen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story sounds like bullshit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It all matches up with the evidence, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you saying he took them out himself before his partner could get upstairs? Or that it just magically disappeared?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But there was blood up the stairs, too, don&rsquo;t forget. It is all consistent with his story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe someone shot Wade with a toy gun, took a round in the thigh or leg, and then ran upstairs to inexplicably vanish? Every building surrounding that roof has no windows and damned sure nothing to climb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe something happened. I just don&rsquo;t know what exactly. It kinda reminds me of that Chavez case, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vic had four chest wounds consistent with a small-caliber firearm. They didn&rsquo;t find anything in him, or any shell casings nearby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t start telling me you believe in magic bullets. You might end up down there someday.&rdquo;</p>
