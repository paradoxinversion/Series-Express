<p>Jo took a drag from nir cigarette as ne bounced nir foot on the ground. Ne was supposed to meet with someone about a job nearly forty-five minutes before.&nbsp;<em>Before&nbsp;</em>dark. Now it was well after. Normally, Jo wouldn&rsquo;t would have bothered waiting, but the sum of money was worth sticking around for. Ne was nearly done with nir cigarette when nir contact finally showed up.</p>
<p>He had thick, red, ratty dreadlocks and broad jaw. He was built like a football player.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M?&rdquo; Jo asked, taking a final drag before casting the cigarette into the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re&nbsp;<em>really&nbsp;</em>late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. I try to not to keep beautiful women waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not go there. Who are you and what are you missing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s . . . more than I expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked you two questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you even want my money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I have a competitor I don&rsquo;t know about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Michael,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Jo stood up, presenting nir middle finger. Ne knew he was lying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck you, I&rsquo;m out. Good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Marcel. I&rsquo;m sorry, alright? I try to stay anonymous in this kind of business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo stopped. &ldquo;I cut on the next round of bullshit. Got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ne sighed. &ldquo;Just call me Jo, OK?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded, avoiding putting his foot any further into his mouth. Jo really was the only tracker of nir caliber who did business with anyone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, Marcel, what are you missing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend of mine. Stan Kennedy.&rdquo; He was lying. It slipped past Jo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems to be happening a lot lately. Do you have anything of theirs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those were your instructions,&rdquo; he said, as he reached into his pack. &ldquo;Be cool, though. It&rsquo;s his gun. It&rsquo;s not loaded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled the compact pistol out slowly, by the barrel. Jo came came closer and he passed it off. Jo put it in nir own pack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Marcel as he turned to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgetting something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fished in his bag another moment, producing a roll of bills. There were three thousand dollars in hundreds. Nir &ldquo;agent&rdquo; had bargained for another three grand when ne finished the job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet you tomorrow. Eight p.m. Fourth and Market. Don&rsquo;t be late this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deal,&rdquo; he said, extending his hand to shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you then,&rdquo; ne said, leaving without acknowledging his attempt. Ne stopped suddenly, turning. &ldquo;Have I met you somewhere before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marcel shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ne stared at him long and hard. He was familiar in some way. Shrugging, ne turned and left. The familiarity bothered nir all the back to nir apartment.</p>
