<p>Molly pushed the buzzer to the shady pawn shop storefront in the Tenderloin. It was two in the morning, and the lights were low inside. Still, a figure darkened the cheap frosted-glass barred door. It lingered only a moment before letting her in. The shop was rigorously ordered. Books, antiques, furniture, and more all appeared, clean and dusted with tags, ready for sale. Despite its outside appearance, it was a shop polished to near perfection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Morning, Molly,&rdquo; said the man who let her in. He had a thick German accent. He looked like a military man, chiseled from stone. His six and half feet dwarfed her five. His gray hair betrayed some hint of age completely without frailty. He checked the time on his phone before setting it on the counter by the cash register.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you, Anders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged, but smiled. He stared at her a moment before furrowing his brow. As all Angels could do, even those Fallen from Grace, he was appraising her soul. He knew how she felt. He could feel she was annoyed, but just slightly. He knew she felt guilty about something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you doing the thing? You&rsquo;re doing the thing, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precaution. Same for everyone. Every time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t judge me,&rdquo; she said, jokingly.</p>
<p>The Angel chuckled. Technically, he was one of the few on earth actually equipped to judge a human soul. Still, he made his mistakes. Now, he sold people&rsquo;s old junk and occasionally a gun or two. The latter wasn&rsquo;t advertised, and Anders was very strict with his clientele. No guns for anyone who would do something malicious with them. That was his personal rule, the one he would not ever break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do, Molly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes to avoid looking at him in the face as hers turned beet red. &ldquo;I might have hit someone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh huh. Keep going. The whole thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the back of the head with a baseball bat. It was a desperate situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;doing the thing&rdquo; again, appraising her response. He knew she was telling the truth. Almost, at least. She was leaving something out. He also knew she felt a bit proud of herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re buying a stereo, right?&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t pass up the opportunity to put her on the spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Anders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can give you a good discount on that SANSO over there. Great sound quality. Almost new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need a gun, Anders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gun? I sell electronics, books, furniture, but no guns that I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anders, seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell me the whole truth, I&rsquo;ll do the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was two people. A friend&rsquo;s sister got wrapped in something bad. Why do you do this to me every time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you tell me half the truth every time,&rdquo; he chuckled, bringing up his hands like a puppet-master. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m training you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t stolen anything from anyone since I sold you first pistol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face turned red again. He was a good influence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you looking for this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another compact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to the one you bought a month ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the people I beamed managed to wrestle it away from me before I got my bat. Tried to execute me, too. It was cute, in a hopeless kinda way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head as he turned and went through the door behind him, returning with a black cardboard box. Inside was a small semi-automatic pistol. She picked it up, feeling it in her hand. It was lighter than she expected and nearly fit her hand perfectly. It was barely bigger than her old compact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just something I cobbled together. You shouldn&rsquo;t notice the recoil at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time? A promise. Stay who you are, but tell the truth more. The whole truth,&rdquo; he said with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deal,&rdquo; she said, extending her hand.</p>
<p>He appraised her. She was serious. They shook symbolically. She paid for half a box of ammo. They exchanged their goodbyes. As Molly neared the door he suddenly at unease. He could sense movement outside of the shop. It was at least four people. Not a single one felt of any good intention.</p>
<p>Then, his phone buzzed on the counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found you, Anders,&rdquo; read the text.</p>
<p>The door&rsquo;s windowpane shattered. Anders barely managed to pull Molly over the counter before the tear gas grenade exploded.</p>
<p>Anders plucked Molly up off the ground like she was a cotton-stuffed doll. The black mark on her hand burned for a moment. The door to the pawn shop burst open and six men moved in, armed and synchronized. It wasn&rsquo;t until they were past the bulk of the smoke that Molly noticed their rifles and gas masks. Each person had the word &ldquo;S.W.A.T.&rdquo; on the front of his black Kevlar body armor in big white letters.</p>
<p>Molly turned and grabbed Anders&rsquo;s wrist. She closed her eyes, expecting to open them in her apartment. Instead, her lungs continued to be invaded with tear gas. One of the invaders had put up a ward so she and Anders couldn&rsquo;t leave. Her eyes burned. She coughed violently as she breathed in more of the noxious fumes. One of the intruders leveled his rifle at her and pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>The volley of bullets stopped short, losing its momentum inches in front of her chest. Eyes burning and tearing up, Molly could barely see the shadow of Anders&rsquo;s wing outstretched to protect her. He hurled her into the back room and followed, slamming and locking the door behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t rub your eyes,&rdquo; he said as he drew a two-by-four into the slat of the door of the makeshift panic room. The room actually did wonders keeping the gas out. Anders placed his palm on Molly&rsquo;s forehead. She breathed deeply, suddenly relieved from the effects of the gas. She could see decently again, but the chemicals that clung to her still bothered her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; she asked, catching her breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story, but I promise you they&rsquo;re not police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mages pretending to be cops? Why ward before they attack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not all mages. They maybe have one with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something thudded heavily against the door. Molly fished around in her bag in a frenzy for the gun he had just given her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t need that,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The phrase struck her with a strange fear. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it like that, Anders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever actually shot anyone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Molly bit her lip. &ldquo;Is there any way out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is it, Molly. There&rsquo;s no way out of this room except through that door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my friend, Anders. I&rsquo;m not going to just let them take you, damn it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. I&rsquo;m also surrendering. That&rsquo;s entirely different. You&rsquo;re not &lsquo;letting them take me&rsquo; at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could wipe them out alone. Without a gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Violence is why I Fell. It&rsquo;s not a path I want to walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Molly fought back tears. She was still high on adrenaline, but she had known Anders for years. She thought he was a hypocritical, self-righteous ass sometimes. Still, he always had advice for her. Kind words on random days when she would walk by the shop and &ldquo;pop in for a moment.&rdquo; He reminded her so much of the brother she lost when she 27, six years ago. It was like she was losing him again. Anders hugged her tightly. He didn&rsquo;t know everything, but he knew enough of how she felt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to find you if they make a mistake along the way for me,&rdquo; he said, smiling.</p>
<p>He said something in Latin, and Molly fell limp in his arms. He laid her on the floor posed as a corpse near the far wall from the door. Someone pounded on the door. The two-by-four cracked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Relax, gentlemen,&rdquo; Anders called through the door. &ldquo;I wanted to give my friend proper last rites. I think you literally gave her a heart attack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the fucking door, Anders,&rdquo; a voiced yelled back, muffled by a gas mask and the thick door between them.</p>
<p>Anders yanked the board from the slot and the men rushed in, four with their guns on him, two with theirs on Molly. They quickly shackled him in cuffs with carved magic wards. One of the men checked Molly. She had no pulse. She didn&rsquo;t breathe. She didn&rsquo;t respond in any way. They signaled her death to the rest who carted Anders outside.</p>
<p>Into a small radio, the man who shackled him said, &ldquo;We have the package. Clear for housekeeping,&rdquo; as the others ordered the Fallen Angel into the counterfeit S.W.A.T. van. With their cargo secure, they drove off.</p>
<p>Molly felt a sensation like landing face first into a pool of water when she woke up in the back room of the shop. She remembered hearing everything that happened. She rose to her feet, briefly unsteady, before grabbing her things and rushing toward the front door. Anders&rsquo;s phone remained lit on the counter. She grabbed it. It would be the first step in tracking him down.</p>
